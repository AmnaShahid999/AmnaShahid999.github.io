About Me
I’m Amna Shahid, a Fulbright Scholar and aspiring data scientist passionate about using data to tell meaningful stories and drive impactful research. Currently, I’m pursuing a Master’s in Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences (Data Science) at Columbia University, where I have been awarded the GSAS 50% Scholarship. I previously earned my B.Sc. in Economics with a minor in Sociology/Anthropology from Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS), Lahore, Pakistan, graduating with distinction.

My work lies at the intersection of data science, public policy, and social impact. I have experience in statistical modeling, econometrics, machine learning, and data visualization, which I’ve applied in both industry and academic research. At EasyPaisa,Pakistan's premier fintech, I analyzed large datasets to enhance customer experience, developed Power BI dashboards, and helped implement data-driven automation to improve efficiency.

In research, I’ve worked on projects examining corruption, socio-economic inequality, climate change, and social protection programs, including a South Asian study supported by the World Bank. My academic work spans from conducting geospatial analyses of pharmaceutical license allocations in Washington, D.C., to studying post-COVID social investment patterns in Pakistan.

I’m also deeply committed to mentorship and knowledge-sharing. At LUMS, I served as an academic writing tutor, mentoring over 600 students in research writing. Currently, as the Alumni Coordinator for the Quantitative Analytics for Social Research (QASR) society, I help connect students with professionals in the field.

I thrive on solving complex problems using Python, STATA, Tableau, and Power BI, and I’m always looking for opportunities to bridge data science with real-world challenges.
